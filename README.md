# Assessment

During work on this task I received only one problem: 

**No LSB modules are available** after ****running **lsb_release -a** command**.** 

I found this info about LSB:

The Linux Standard Base delivers interoperability between applications and the Linux operating system. Debian discontinued LSB support in 2015. The LSB offers a cost-effective way for application vendors to target multiple Linux distributions while building only one software package. For end-users, the LSB and its mark of interoperability preserve choice by allowing them to select the applications and distributions they want while avoiding vendor lock-in. LSB certification of distributions results in more applications being ported to Linux and ensures that distribution vendors are compatible with those applications.

And I run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install lsb-core 
```

to install lsb-core.

After this I started receiving this output:

```bash
LSB Version:	core-11.1.0ubuntu2-noarch:security-11.1.0ubuntu2-noarch
```
